# hello-world

Today is the 10/30/2020 my first trial on GIT aiming to learn to use TensorFlow/Paddle-lite to do some work on Object Detection.
After leaving school working for 13 years, my main work is on Middle Company Network building and maintance, small information system development such
as HR/workflowï¼Œbut I never wirte about the things I learnt or done on GIT
I also love painting, cook, cats.
so hope to learn more and making new friends.
